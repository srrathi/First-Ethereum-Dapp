## First Dapp made using Ethereum
 - Smart contract is deployed on Kovan Network using injected Web# on remix online IDE.
 - During Development used Truffle for connecting my Smart Contract with my React App.
 - Used Ganache to setup and deploy the Blockchain Network locally on my machine.

 - Used Metamask web extension for the transactions and account lookup
 - Used npm Web3 package to communicate between metamask and application.
 - The whole web App is made using Bootstrap and React.
